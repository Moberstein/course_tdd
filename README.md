# Test Driven Development
This repository holds the resources for the presentation held about Test Driven Development

## Presentation
The presentation material can be found in the doc folder [right here](./doc/TDD.pdf).

## What to do
Based on this repository you can go ahead and try to implement an example application with the Test Driven Development approach.

### What's the goal of this example?
- Implement a save division example
- Learn the TDD approach

### Where can I start?
- Clone the repository
- Use the prepared branch `base` as starting point
- Finish to write a correct Test in the `divideZero` function of the predefined class `DivisionTest`
- Implement some code to make all tests green
- Think about other possible tests and implement one of them
- Write the code needed to turn the test green
- Do the same with all the other test cases you can think about

### Where can I look if I'm stuck?
- Just consider reading this part if you are really stuck
- Really, it shouldn't be that hard to follow the instructions
- Well, there you go
- Some example test cases are implemented at the `master` branch
- Just look at the [commit history](https://github.com/Moberstein/course_tdd/commits/master)
